# Action-Network-Webhook
This PHP webhook allows you to sync contacts from Action Network into an EveryAction committee.

## Set-up
1. In your Action Network group, go to the API & Sync page (under Details)
2. Find the Webhooks section and add a new webhook
3. Enter the URL where the webhook is publicly accessible and choose when to run it (if you want every contact added from now on, we recommend "All Actions Plus Uploads")
4. Click Save
